  Lite CSIT Solution:
  This is a web app/site where the CSIT Student can view the solutions of Limited Semester past questions. This is only a demo version of app. The app may be slower because it is only built upon HTML &amp; and Javascript. No Database, No Backend Code.
  Many more.......

Why is this site/app Developed?
- it is cost-efficient
- No need to buy an expensive server
- using GitHub pages, clients can render images by just uploading the images with n-numbered 
- for example, if the client wants to render an image then they have to upload by keeping the name image-1.jpg, image-2.jpg and so on
- numbering of images is most 
- dynamic content loading
- Once loaded,available for offline viewing
- best suited for small business or individuals
